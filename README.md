# Getting Started with Simple USFM Alignment Prototype

Version 0.6.0 needs the adverb "almost" in front of it -- Almost a Simple USFM Alignment Prototype. It includes:
* Side-by-side USFM areas for the Original Source Language, an Aligned Bridge Language, and the Target Language.
* Expandable and Collapsible sections and paragraphs, synchronized across all three areas.
* Placeholder for an alignment area -- "Coming Soon", currently with selected chapter and verse reference to be aligned displayed.
    * Important: Ability to store aligned target language information a project will be "Coming Later".
* Drafting, editing, USFM formatting, and exporting of the Target Language
