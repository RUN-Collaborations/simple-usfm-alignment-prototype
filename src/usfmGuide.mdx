# Markers
Markers are characters immediately preceeded by a backslash and followed by a space. They identify how a document is organized and convey important and helpful information about the text.

A list of **Common Markers** are below, followed by both left-to-right and right-to-left **Examples**, with a **Book Code Reference** at the bottom of this page.

## Common Markers
- `\c #` Chapter (required) - `\c`is followed by a space, then the chapter number in place of `#`, then another space, all on a line of its own, like this:\
        `\c 1`
- `\s#` Section (optional) - `\s`is followed by a space, then the section number within the chapter in place of `#`, then the section title, all on a line of its own, like this:\
        `\s1 Title of the First Section in a Chapter`
- `\v #` Verse (required) - `\v` is always placed at the very begining of a line, followed by a space, then the verse number in place of `#`, another space, and then the verse, like this:\
        `\v 1 This is verse one.`
- `\p` Paragraph with an indented first line (optional) - `\p` is placed on a line of its own, indicating the start of a new paragraph, like this:\
        `\v 5 This is the last verse in a paragraph.`\
        `\p`\
        `\p 6 This is the first verse in a new paragraph.`\
    Note: When a paragraph without an indent is desired, then use `\m` in place of `\p`. The "m" stands for margin (with no indent).
- `\mt#` Major Title (name of the book) - `\mt#` goes in the heading section at the top of the file on a line of its own. The highest priority title is indicated by the number 1 in place of `#`, with any subtitles (optional) indicated by sequential numbers, like this:\
        `\mt1 Acts` (required)\
        `\mt2 of the Apostles` (optional)
