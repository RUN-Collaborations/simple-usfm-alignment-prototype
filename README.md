# Project Goals
 * Offline translating, editing, and aligning that accepts all valid [USFM](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/) formatting. Aligning in this context refers to mapping translated results and the source to indicate granular correlation.
 * Stay simple. We strive to become and remain the most functional bottom-rung in the space.
 * Designed from the beginning for full offline use compatibility.

## Almost a Simple USFM Alignment Prototype

Version 0.6.0 needs the adverb "*almost*" in front of it -- ***Almost*** a Simple USFM Alignment Prototype. It includes:
* Side-by-side USFM areas for the Original Source Language, an Aligned Bridge Language, and the Target Language.
* Expandable and collapsible chapters and paragraphs
    * Chapter selection synchronized across all three areas.
* *Placeholder* for an alignment area
    * This feature is *Coming Soon*. Currently it only displays the selected chapter and verse reference to be aligned.
    * Important: Ability to **store** aligned target language information a project is *not* coming as soon. This will be "Coming ***Later***". This prototype does ***not yet*** save alignment!
* Translating, editing, [USFM](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/) formatting, and exporting of the Target Language

## See it in Action Online

While Version 0.6.0 can be experienced [online](https://simple-usfm-alignment-prototype.netlify.app/), it requires having or obtaining [USFM](https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/) files to have something to open.

## Install the Progressive Web App (PWA) for an Offline Experience

An installation option will be presented by web browsers that support this PWA's, such as Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, MS Edge, Google Chrome, other Chromium-based web browsers, and Safari. Firefox support is available through [Progressive Web Apps for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefoxpwa/).

Icons indicating progressive web app download availability differ by browser, though tend to have a plus sign in them and tend to be on the top row of the browser next to the web address. A mousever will indicate that an app is available, and a click will provide an opportunity to install.
